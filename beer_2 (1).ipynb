Definitely a spice forward fragrance. Flavor has an odd burn that hits on the first sip. After it fades it seems like a dirty vanilla aftertaste. Perhaps this is the absinthe? Regardless of that, I get a quite spiced tone on the tongue. Almost feel a little heat from it. I think that my inexperienced palate on these spices is contributing to my ignorance of what precisely they are. Overall a nice drinker indeed.   \n",

Mostly a light candy flavor like in the aroma. Full bodied with good carbonation. The finish is some lingering sweet flavor with a bit of bitterness.\\t\\tA very sweet barleywine with a weird hard candy flavor that seemed to dominate.

It might have to be your cup of tea, but I dig it. If you like lambics, you will like this. After two 9 ounce beers and a burger, this was my dessert. As it got closer to the end, I wished there would have been more. \\t\\tI weep for you if you go in and this beer is not available.\n",

Foggy yellow orange with a thick creme head that leaves a very thick lacing on the way down. Nose is tangy citrus with heavy pine tones. Flavor is extremely smooth. Extremely. There is still a bite of pine and hop tones with fairly strong bitter aftertastes and a slight salty thing in the back of my mouth. But like I said, it is really easy to swig this one down. Feel is smooth on liquid, carbonation is lower. I can dig this. A bit acidic and biting, but in the right ways.\n",

Thin light tan head. Flavor is sweet, and too much so I have to say. Calms down a bit over time, but the memory of it sticks with me. Fruit tones and a tart bitterness ride on the backside of things. Feel is slick on liquid and the carbonation is slightly subdued. This is an okay beer. As it warms it's initially abrasive qualities seem to calm down a bit and I enjoy it more than I thought I would.\n",

All I get is a burning sensation as if the beer was mixed with rubbing alcohol or some solvent. I guess the barrel is to blame for this, but it is completely abrasive and undrinkable. All DIPA characteristics are also overshadowed by this harsh bite. Hopefully this was just a bad keg, but I waited 15 minutes in line at a bar to get this and there were 7 Founders employees in the house. So there is really no excuse for this one. Atrocious.\n",

Minimal tan head does not stay long at all. Nose is nice and fruity with a decent amount of sugar/candy in the mix as well. Flavor is pretty robust. I guess the rye really comes into effect here and gives a fairly bodied experience. Seems like the profile is mostly of wood. Nice and hearty really.

Minimal tannish head doesn't really stay long, but leaves decent lacing on the way down. Nose is super floral hops. Strong and unrelenting. Flavor is very strong. Acidic almost at first. Firm woody edges. Very, very earthy. Feel is sticky on liquid and the carbonation is good. Surprisingly, this ends up being a pretty drinkable DIPA as I tore through the bottle and was finished well before I wished. A nice DIPA, though a bit heavy on the robust side.\n",

Nose is pungent pine and salty hops. Flavor is quite salty and intense. Not precisely the \"wet-hopped\" characters I would expect, but really: how wet can the hops be upon delivery to Michigan? Not hatin', just sayin'. On the powerfully salty hops with minor pine tones there seems like some obliterated lemon tang as well. Feel is smooth and slightly thick on liquid and the carbonation is middle of the road. This is super hoppy and I can dig it. But the label says \"wet-hopped ale\" and I would have never guessed so in a blind taste test.\n",

Talk about a fall time brew. Seeing as how I am in the middle of August, I feel like it might be a bit early to be having such a seasonal beer. Feel has a nice carbonation to it. Liquid is pretty well bodied. This is a very good beer. A nice example of the style. If you are interested in the style, definitely try this one out. Pretty interesting I have to say.\n",

Nose is like cocoa powder. Flavor starts off promising but kind of falls off fairly quickly, leaving a noticeable alcohol aftertaste. There is a nice coffee and malt and chocolate flavor in there, but the feel of everything just knocks it down a notch I say. Just too thin, or maybe it is just that it is thinner than the others I have tried. There is also an odd saltiness to it I think. Drinkable, sure.

Nose is clogged with character. Globs of hops and malts with alcohol in the mix as well. Flavor is fully hops. It reminds me a lot of the DFH 120. Just thick hop character that needs some time to calm down. Sickly sweet aftertaste lingers after the ridonkulous hop invasion. Feel is pretty smooth.\\t\\tThis needs time to mellow.

Flavor is clearly smoked. This is like a rauchbier, yet Belgian in style. Defined meat tones and smoky as well. As I drink more of it, I see where it comes from on the nose. Besides everything else so far, there is a clear sweet edge with fruit tones as well. As time goes on the rauch qualities fade away and a sweet tone really sets in. Yet occasionally the rauch character hits me in the back of the mouth as an aftertaste ever so subtly. Feel is slick and smooth, yet a bit thick, on liquid. Carbonation is middle of the road. Well this was an interesting beer. I definitely suggest you try it if you have the chance.\n",

Nose is heavily malted. Strong syrupy sugar character follows that. Flavor is malty with a strong sweetness and an underlying tone of bark or possibly a mild wood. Touch of smoke on there. Feel is bordering on syrupy. Drinkable, sure. A good brew. Nothing outstanding, but pretty solid all the same.\n",

Nose is sweet like chocolate would be, but is overall mild and has no extreme character. Flavor is very smooth, but at the same time is very sweet. I want to say it is bordering on too sweet, if it has not already crossed that line. Slight malt tones underneath all that sugary sweetness. Mouthfeel is low with carbonation. Drinkable, sure. But for some the extreme sweet might be a turn off.\n",

Nose is almost like old wood. Like a cleaned out old attic. Dusty and void of life. A mild bit of malt character there, but not a whole lot. Flavor is smooth and even. Nothing real crazy going on here. Thin malt influence. Has the body, but not a lot of character to follow. Feel is standard. A bit thin really. Drinkable, sure. It is a decent brew. Nice to try. But no home run to run back to.\n",

Nose is hoppy, of course, but has a soapy edge. Overall fragrances are not very powerful and carry very minor pine character. Flavor is smooth. Balanced bitter tones with noticeable leafy and woody hop tones, though not firm or anywhere near overpowering. Seems like some alcohol is there as well. Feel is nice. Pretty full carbonation on a slick liquid feel. This is a nice drinker. More woody than most other things. I think this on cask would be interesting.\n",

Nose is faint perfumed, citric hops. Flavor is nice and meaty and robust. By just a touch it seems slightly amber ale in character, but the basic theme is the floral leafy and twig kind of thing. Feel is smooth on the liquid and the carbonation is a bit high with a very slight bite to it. Overall I think this is a nice brew. Perhaps I am being jaded as I appreciate this type of IPA. But I think it's nice and worth giving a shot. I'd definitely have more than one if I had the chance.\n",

Nose is a quick hit of citrus hops that dies real quick (as in a matter of a half second.) Flavor is a biting pine and citrus hop thing. Slightly salty. More brightly citric than anything else though. Feel is a bit thicker and sticky on liquid. Carbonation is lower. Decent as an APA. Might be interesting on cask.\n",

Nose is hopped and slightly cherry sweet, with a stronger overall sugary tone to it. Flavor is lacking. Seems to be a bit too traditional, but it falls off way too fast. Almost tastes like semi stale pretzels...or just pretzels in general. There is an overall bitter tone to it, but I just think it lacks. Feel is nice with a decent carbonation. Drinkable, yes. Isn't horrid, but it's definitely not the best ESB you've ever had.\n",

Nose is perfumed hops, but not a blast to the nose. Nice and even, but firm. Flavor is very nice. Hops are there, but this is no bomb. Just gives a solid hit to the mouth. Lots of pine-y hops. Feel is decent. A bit thinner on the liquid than I would have expected, but a good level of carbonation. Overall very drinkable. I would be down for trying this on tap, or even better, on cask.\n",

Nose is malty with an almost cardboard tree kind of thing going on. The first thing I thought when I took a sip was: boozy! Thankfully that seems to fade away as time goes on. What I get after that is a thick malty backbone with a sweet earthy edge. Peaty edge on the backside. Full flavor profile, not a mass of complexity. Feel is smooth on liquid and carbonation is lower. After the booze calms down here this gets better.\\t\\tThanks to tburkhart for this one."
